##5. Brief process overview

###5.1 Below threshold procurement

Below threshold procurement complaints are transferred to the advisory body, created at the Transparency International, that has its own user cabinet. Simplified, the complaint review process is as follows:

![Complaints for Below threshold procurement](/images/complaints/en_complaints_below_threshold.png)

In addition to existing opportunity to ask questions about the procurement procedure, any user registered in the system (except Procuring entities) can contact Procuring entity and make a Violation elimination claim (Article 23 of the Law).

The Procuring entity has three days to review the Claim and make a decision on it. During this period the Procuring entity must publish a response to the Claim and (in the case of complaint satisfaction) amend the appropriate procurement conditions or awarding procedure results.

Complainant must assess the complaint resolution. If he/she is satisfied with the decision, the incident is exhausted and the process ends. If he/she is not satisfied, or if the Procuring entity did not review the Claim, it automatically becomes a Complaint for the Complaint Review body to investigate.

The Complaint Review body reviews the Complaint and publishes a decision on it. This decision is conveyed to the Procuring entity and Participants, and is automatically published on the eMalls’ websites and official web portal of the Authorized body. The decision of the Complaint Review body has recommendatory character and does not lead to procedure blocking.

###5.2 Above threshold procurement

Complaints to the above threshold procurement are transferred to the official Complaint Review body (the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine) that has a separate user cabinet.

Similarly to the complaint process for the below threshold procurement, any user registered in any eMall can contact Procuring entity and make a Violation elimination claim about the tender conditions, and, in case of dismissal, turn it into a Complaint. In addition, user can submit a Complaint without the previously created Claim.

Simplified, the process of Complaint submission and review looks this way:

![Complaints for Above threshold procurement](/images/complaints/en_complaints_above_threshold.png)

After the Complaint submission, a representative of the Complaint Review body checks:

* whether Complaint technically complies with the Law requirements;
* if Complainant paid the fee;
* whether Procuring entity eliminated violation.

If all of the conditions are carried out, Complaint is accepted for review. Otherwise, it is rejected. 

*Complaints about the procurement conditions*, accepted for review, block the start of the auction for the period of Complaint review. After the publication of the Complaint Review body's decision, if the Complaint was dismissed, procedure is unblocked and the system replans the date of the auction. In case of Complaint satisfaction (full or partial) the procedure is unblocked, but the Enquiries period end date changes to "determining" so that the Procuring entity is able to amend the tender documents or to cancel the procedure.

*Awarding decision Complaints*, accepted for review, block the opportunity to publish a contract with the winner. If the Complaint was dismissed, procedure is unblocked. The Procuring entity carries out the decision of the Complaint Review body under its own responsibility, there are no additional automatic control means.

In addition, before the decision publication by the Complaint Review body, the Procuring entity can eliminate the violations on its own and inform the Complaint Review body about it. The review body will check the violation elimination and make its decision.

Submitted complaints and their resolutions are published on the eMall websites and the official web portal of the Authorized body.

##6. Detailed process overview

</table>

###6.2 Complaint submission (below threshold procurement)

If Procuring entity does not review the Claim within three days, it automatically becomes a Complaint.

If the Procuring entity has reviewed the claim, Complainant assesses its decision.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr style="background-color: #4F81BD;">
            <td><span style="color: #ffffff;">Field</span></td>
            <td><span style="color: #ffffff;">Description</span></td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>claims:satisfied</strong></td>
            <td>Yes, No, or empty</span></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

If the Complainant is not satisfied with the decision, he can turn (escalate) the Claim into Complaint. But the Complainant can not submit a Complaint if he did not make a Claim to the Procuring entity before it. If the Complainant has not assessed the Procuring entity’s decision within three days, it is automatically considered to be satisfied.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr style="background-color: #4F81BD;">
            <td><span style="color: #ffffff;">Field</span></td>
            <td><span style="color: #ffffff;">Description</span></td>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>claims:dateEscalated</strong></td>
            <td>Date of escalation registration in CDB</span></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

            <td>Contact person e-mail</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>claims:justification</strong></td>
